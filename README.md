This project is being migrated from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcradar/

# Overview #
GcRadar is a library that will monitor the activities of the Java Garbage collector on the objects of the client codes choosing. It is designed to give the client source code access to such information. The library can provide this information by using callbacks, log4j and simple polling by the client code. The library can also be used by developers for unit-testing memory intensive code.
